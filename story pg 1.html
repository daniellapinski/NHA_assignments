<p><h2> One day a man in a mask was walking. Everyone was staring at him. He was an unknown person with an unknown identity. He wore a hoodie along with a pair of jeans and Jordans(Nice shoes). Everyone thought he was just a wierdo in a mask. What many people didn't know, was that he saved lives everyday.</h2> </p>
