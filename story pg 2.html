<p><h2>This man possessed many masks. He walked the alley ways and gave to the poor. One time, he saw a lady get robbed. He ran after the robber and punched him in the face. He pulled out duct tape and tied his hands and feet together. He went over to the lady and while giving her her purse,he said, "Call the cops and tell them where you are. Tell them the whole truth." Then  he walked away.
